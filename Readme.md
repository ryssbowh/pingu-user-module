### Users and roles
This module define users and roles in database and the relation between the two.

It replaces laravel default User, so that we can reuse most of the laravel's logic for login/register etc.

It defines the logic to reset a password throught the backend.

Lots of Controller have been written/copied, not sure which are used to be honest :)
